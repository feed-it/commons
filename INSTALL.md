# How to install the package

You just have to run the following command in your project: `pnpm add [-D] github:@feed-it/commons`.

Note the `github:` prefix to tell npm, yarn or pnpm to find the package in the GitHub repository.

If you want to specify the version you can use the `@[~^]x.x.x` suffix. Or use the `latest` tag (optionally).
